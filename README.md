# SNP-MM

## Introduction
SAS demostraction for "Evaluating Risk-Adjusted Hospital Performance Using Large-Scale Data on Mortality Rates of Patients in Intensive Care Units: A Flexible Semi-Nonparametric Modeling Approach". Main macro ***SNP_MM()*** is avaiable. We propose a class of hospital compare models that embraces nonparametric mean structures with semi-nonparametric hospital random effects. Such models are further improved and integrated into a zero-inflated model.
